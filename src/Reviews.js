                <p>This is where reviews of games can appear.  Perhaps I'll create 
                    it as a list that can reload back into the target frame with
                    the selected review.
                </p>
                <p>I am trying to take inspiration from mobile applications and 
                    websites alike.  It is interesting how mobile applications have
                    designed out of the box to display the same amount of information
                    as a full-fledged site.
